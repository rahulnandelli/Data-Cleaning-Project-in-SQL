# Data Cleaning Project using SQL

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **Data Cleaning SQL script** that helps preprocess and clean raw datasets. The script includes various SQL queries to handle missing values, remove duplicates, normalize data, and ensure data consistency.

## 📂 Files in this Repository
- `Data Cleaning Project.sql` - SQL script for performing data cleaning.

## 📊 Features
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing data formats
- Normalizing data
- Identifying and fixing inconsistent data entries

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
To run this SQL script, you need:
- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any SQL-supported platform.
- **Dataset**: Ensure you have a dataset loaded into your database.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Open your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL, or a cloud-based SQL editor).
3. Import your dataset into the database.
4. Execute `Data Cleaning Project.sql` in your SQL environment.
5. Analyze and verify the cleaned data.

## 📝 Example Queries
```sql
-- Removing duplicates
DELETE FROM your_table
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id) FROM your_table GROUP BY column_name
);

-- Standardizing text format
UPDATE your_table
SET column_name = LOWER(column_name);

-- Handling missing values by replacing NULLs with a default value
UPDATE your_table
SET column_name = 'Unknown'
WHERE column_name IS NULL;
```

## 🛠 Tools Used
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server)
